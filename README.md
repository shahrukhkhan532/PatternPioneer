# 🔄 Modernizing Legacy Code with 🧩 Design Patterns in C#

👋 Welcome to the repository that demonstrates the transformation of legacy code into a modern architecture leveraging the power of various design patterns. This repository serves as a hands-on companion to the article: ["Modernizing Legacy Code: The Road to Design Patterns Mastery in C#"](https://medium.com/@shahrukhkhan_7802/modernizing-legacy-code-the-road-to-design-patterns-mastery-in-c-12a7cbb6873).

## 💡 Introduction

Legacy code is like that old house you inherit - it's filled with memories, but perhaps not wired for today's devices. To make it relevant and efficient for the current age, we've used various design patterns which include:
- **Dependency Injection (DI):** 🧪 A technique that allows an object to receive its dependencies from outside rather than creating them internally.
- **Inversion of Control (IoC):** 🔄 A principle where the control over custom-written portions of a program is inverted, moving it away from the main routine to a framework or service.
- **Strategy Pattern:** 🧠 Allows selecting an algorithm's implementation at runtime.
- **Factory Pattern:** 🏭 Provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass but allows subclasses to alter the types of objects that will be created.
- **Template Method Pattern:** 📑 Defines the program skeleton in a method in an algorithm but delays some steps to subclasses.
- **Decorator Pattern:** 📔 Add dynamically behavior to an individual object without changing the behavior.
